## What is sequencer?
Sequencer allows you to create **simple and clear sequence diagrams**, based on a simple grammar. Your diagram is **drawn in real-time** as you type, and is designed to be:
 - easy to **edit**
 - easy to **share**
 - easy to **version control**

## Simple to get started

#### Describe your sequence
`Client -> Server: Request`

`Server -> Server: Parses request`

`Server -> Service: Query`

`Service -> Server: Data`

`Server -> Client: Response`

#### Your diagram is ready to go

Copy the diagram to your clipboard to paste straight in to chat or email.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/rsouth/sequencer/wiki) for the current grammar.
